# msj-attendance
Msj-Attendance is a project to try to automate attendance at Mission San Jose High. In partnership with Dr.Brucker, the APCS teacher, we hope to make attendance super easy and automated. 

## How it works
Each classroom will be equipped with an AttendancePod, which is a fingerprint sensor connected to a WiFi-enabled Esp8266. Whenever a student enters/exits a classroom, they scan their finger. The Esp8266 notifies a server, which keeps logs of all activity. At the start of every period, the list of present students by ID is sent to illuminate/schoolloop. The Teachers will never have to touch attendance again. 

## In progress
We expect to finish by Mid-April, post-testing and everything.
